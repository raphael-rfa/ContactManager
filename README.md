# Contact Manager(Under Development)

Web application in the MVC pattern for storing contacts,  
allowing the creation of new contacts with the following data:  

Name;  
Address;  
City;  
State;  
Zip;  
Email.  

The application displays all registered contacts in a table but  
allows a common user to edit and delete only their data, a user  
registered as a manager can reject the record of a contact, can  
accept the record or submit the record, just one user registered  
as administrator has unrestricted access to all contacts.

Final project of the Microsoft documentation on Authorization,  
my only problem is that the project is written for Razor Pages   
and I want to specialize in the MVC pattern, I already did the  
conversion of Razor Pages projects to MVC, but for this project  
I lack the knowledge of DI and of Controllers so I'm going to  
postpone the project until when I have more knowledge, I'm going  
to go back to RoadMap and focus on the fundamentals.
